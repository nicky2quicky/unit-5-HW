Directions:

Upon loading the game index.html, you should have a start screen with both two buttons that both work the same "Start Game" or "Restart",  letting the player know that he/she can start over if needed in the middle.

Upon selecting start or restart, the buttons will automatically populate using JQuery with answer options and a questions will be displayed above these button options.

Once the questions are displayed, the player will need to make one of four choices as their correct answer. If they answer correctly, they will be prompted with a correct, and incorrect if they are wrong. If they choose not to answer and the time runs out, they will be notfified that time has run out.

After 2.5 seconds of their answer or time expiring, the screen will then popualte with the next questions with the same parameters as listed above. 

The quiz is a total of 8 Civil War questions.

At the end of the trivia, the player's score will be displayed in 3 categories of Correct Answers, Incorrect Answers, and Unanswered Questions. The player will have the option to start new game again if they wish to play again.


****Note for some reason I continuously have trouble with my images showing through the link on GitHub. The game should have a neat Civil War Portrait as the jumbotron background.
